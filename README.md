# Excel-Demo

This is another demo of using Python modules and packages with virtual environment.
The package that we used is "colorama"
After downloading this folder, you will need to:
- Create a virtual environment and activate it
- Install the dependencies listed requirements.txt file (only one pp)
- run the main application python file

# Step1 (can be done only one time): 
Create your virtual environment

To create a virtual environment, decide upon a directory where you want to place it, 
and run the venv module as a script with the directory path:
>> python3 -m venv tutorial-env
OR
>> python -m venv tutorial-env


# Step2 (done when opening your app): 
Activate your virtual environment

Once youâ€™ve created a virtual environment, you may activate it.
- On Windows, run:
    - >> tutorial-env\Scripts\activate.bat
    - >> .\tutorial-env\Scripts\activate OR tutorial-env\Scripts\activate
- On Unix or MacOS, run:
    - >>source tutorial-env/bin/activate

In our example: my-venv\Scripts\activate

# Step3: (can be done only one time): 
Install the required package:
>> pip install colorama

Now You are ready to start coding!
Yes, you can leave step4 till the end

# Step4: Creating the "requirements.txt"
>> pip freeze > requirements.txt
